<i><b>SETUP</b></i>
<p>
All settings are automatically persisted.
<p>
<b><i>Show Results</i></b>: whether to show test results during the test.
You can always see results on the Results screen.
This determines whether they also show up on the test screen.
<p>
<b><i>Sync Play</i></b>: whether to synchronize play during the test.
When checked, the play position of the clips is synchronized;
they all play at the same position as you switch back and forth.
Otherwise (when not checked), each clip remembers its individual play position,
saves that position when you switch to another clip,
and resumes at that position when you switch back to it.
<p>
<b><i>Switch Delay</i></b>: how long to delay (silence) when switching A/B/X.
Setting this to 0 means instantaneous switching which makes it easier to hear differences.
<p>
<b><i>Clip Dir</i></b>: default directory for clip files.
This defaults to the standard <b>downloads</b> directory on your device.
This setting exists only to make it faster and easier to select clips.
On the Clip screen, you can ignore this and enter any path you want.
<p>
<i><b>CLIPS</i></b>
<p>
<b><i>Path</i></b>: where on your device filesystem to load the clip.
This can be anywhere.
You can select a wide variety of different audio files.
On most devices, this includes WAV, MP3, AAC, FLAC, and others.
<p>
<b><i>Volume</i></b>: at what volume to play the clip during the test.
Default is 0 dB, which means play the clip unchanged at its inherent level.
To prevent any potential problems with clipping, you can play the clip quieter, but not louder.
This setting is used to level match clips.
